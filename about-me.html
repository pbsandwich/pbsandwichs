                    <p>I got the computer bug while attending Fresno State from 1983 to 1986. I learned PASCAL and BASIC on their PDP and Cyber mainframes. Through their Center for Computer Assisted Instruction and McGraw Hill, we created college-level courseware in Applesoft and PASS. At Kennel Bookstore, I sold both Macs and PCs to students and faculty.</p>

					<p>Working for Mike Murach & Associates, I learned to program in COBOL using WANG mini computers and IBM mainframes. I also taught a COBOL training course.</p>
					<p>After my girlfriend graduated from Fresno State&apos;s Engineering program, we got married. She landed an aerospace industries position at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB).</p>

                    <p>At Edwards AFB, I held a top&apos;secret clearance working for Computer Sciences Corporation. We produced the test reports that kept our skies safe. As Documentation Specialist, I learned DOS, WordPerfect, PageMaker and&mdash;I could tell you more, but then they&apos;d have to kill you. <i>Just kidding.</i> Maybe.</p>
					<p>Edwards AFB was an incredible place to work. Heading there one day, you might have to stop to let a farmer and his herd of sheep cross the road. Another day a B2 bomber would fly over your car. You could step outside your building and watch one of the space shuttles land on the dry lakebed.</p>

					<p>I wanted to become a game designer for Sierra Online, but I kept getting rejection letters. At AppleFest, my wife bought kitty-cat computer paper.  I needed something to make my resume stand out, so I printed out my resume on a sheet of her kitty cat paper. It worked. They hired me. We left Aerospace and moved back to Fresno.</p>
					<p>Working for Sierra Online was like working in the future. They created games with real talking characters and gorgeous soundtracks. They were burning games on CD-ROM when you could only do that in one or two places in our country. They had an online gaming network via dial-up servers which really pushed the boundaries of Sierra Telephone. Awesome!</p>
					<p>I wore many hats at Sierra Online&mdash;answering phones and writing tech support letters; writing hint-line scripts, books, and game documentation; building computers from scratch; and game design. The <a href="http://www.squakenet.com/download/the-island-of-dr-brain/4991/" title="" target="_blank">Island of Dr. Brain</a> won PC Player Magazine&apos;s <i>Puzzle Game of the Year.</i></p>

                    <p>When Sierra Online moved to Bellevue Washington, we decided to stay in Fresno. I created a company called Creative Computer Consulting. Sierra Online and Hanford Elementary Schools were among my first clients.</p>
					<p>During this time, we also had two kids. Alex was born in 1994 and Katie in 1996.</p>

                    <p>I took a job with CoolTEC and cut back working my own business to just weekends. At CoolTec, we created applications for clients such as Harris Farms, Zacky Farms, Foster Farms, Kaprillian Brothers, and State Farm insurance. We used Microsoft Visual Studio, SQL Server, Office, Crystal Reports, and even a project in Oracle.</p>

					<p>After a short divorce, I started working for Britz Fertilizers as lead programmer in their Y2K conversion. We converted their accounting system from UNIX / B4 Basic to Microsoft Visual Studio and SQL Server.</p>

                    <p>After completing the Y2K conversion at Britz Fertilizers, I worked for Pollstar. At Pollstar, we converted 80&apos;s desktop database apps (such as dBase and foxpro) to newer systems using Visual Studio and SQL Server. We created their online store and wrote many reports using Crystal Reports.</p>
					<p>At PollStar, I met my future second wife. Stephanie loves to travel. We&apos;ve visited London, Alaska, Hawaii (all the islands), and many other places around the US. She&apos;s traveled through every state. One day, we hope to go to Australia.</p>

					<p>After completing projects at PollStar, I continued to work in my own business. In 2007, I went on staff for St Paul Newman Center. I created the weekly bulletin using Adobe InDesign, answered phones at the front desk, provided computer and network support, and parking lot security.</p>
					<p>IN 2008, my Dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I left the Newman Center and lived with him until he passed. During that time, my Mom was also diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. She died a few months after him.</p>

					<p>IN 2014, I met Brian Griggs. He&apos;d dreamed of a QuickBooks project for over 15 years. Together, we created <a href="http://www.thecommissiongenie.com" target="_blank">CommissionGenie</a>, a program that automates paying commissions from QuickBooks for Windows. We&apos;re currently creating CommissionGenie online, an online version for Windows Desktop.
